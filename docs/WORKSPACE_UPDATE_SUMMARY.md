## 🎯 Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why Full-Screen Portal?

- **Immersive experience** - No distractions
- **Professional feel** - Like enterprise software
- **More screen space** - Better for file management
- **Separate context** - Clear mental model (demo vs. workspace)

### Why Dark Theme?

- **Modern aesthetic** - Premium, professional
- **Reduced eye strain** - For long work sessions
- **Better contrast** - White text on dark = readable
- **Differentiation** - Distinct from main site (light theme)

### Why 5 Views vs. Tabs?

- **Progressive disclosure** - Show one thing at a time
- **Mobile-friendly** - Easier navigation on small screens
- **Scalability** - Easy to add more views later
- **Performance** - Only render active view

### Why Visibility Controls?

- **Core feature** - Multi-level access is key differentiator
- **Real need** - Users want granular control
- **Compliance** - Legal requirements for data access
- **Trust** - Transparency builds confidence

### Why Consolidated Sections?

- **DRY principle** - Don't repeat yourself
- **Consistency** - Unified design language
- **Focus** - Data room concept, not "private AI node"
- **Performance** - Less code, faster load

## 🔄 Migration Path

### Current: Demo Mode

- Simulated AI responses
- Mock lawyer presence
- Client-side only
- No persistence

### Next: Backend Integration

1. **WebSocket chat** - Socket.io for real-time
2. **File storage** - AWS S3 / Azure Blob
3. **Database** - PostgreSQL for state
4. **AI API** - OpenAI/Anthropic integration
5. **Auth** - Auth0 / Firebase
