## 🚨 Common Questions

### "Is my data safe?"
Yes! Bank-level encryption, zero-knowledge architecture, and strict access controls. Even Lex employees can't read your data.

### "Can I delete messages?"
Clients can delete their own messages within 5 minutes. After that, messages are permanent (for audit trail). You can leave the data room to revoke access.

### "What if I don't trust the AI?"
Always have your lawyer review important AI analysis. AI is a tool to speed things up, not replace legal judgment.

### "Can I use this in court?"
The timeline and audit trail are designed to be court-admissible. Export feature provides certified logs.

### "How much does it cost?"
- AI chat: Free, unlimited
- Lawyer time: By the hour (shown in profile)
- File storage: Included up to 10GB
- Additional storage: $10/month per 10GB

### "What if my lawyer is unavailable?"
AI is always available 24/7. For urgent matters, request emergency coverage (additional fee). We can also suggest backup attorneys.
