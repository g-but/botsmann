## 🔐 Data-Driven Expansion

### Jurisdiction Priority Score

```
Score = (User Requests × 3) +
        (Market Size × 2) +
        (Lawyer Availability × 2) +
        (Legal Complexity × -1) +
        (Strategic Value × 1)
```

**Example**:

- Geneva: (80 requests × 3) + (8 market × 2) + (7 lawyers × 2) + (-5 complexity) + (9 strategic) = 274
- Texas: (120 requests × 3) + (9 market × 2) + (6 lawyers × 2) + (-3 complexity) + (7 strategic) = 397

→ **Texas prioritized over Geneva**

---

## 📝 Summary

**Current MVP**: Zürich 🇨🇭 + California 🇺🇸 (federal laws only)

**Next Steps**:

1. Add local laws to existing jurisdictions
2. Track user requests for new locations
3. Expand Swiss cantons (Geneva, Bern, Basel)
4. Expand US states (NY, TX, FL)
5. International markets (UK, DE, SG)

**Principle**:
