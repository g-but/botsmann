3. **Progressive disclosure**: Show info when needed, hide complexity
4. **Active states**: Visual feedback on tap (`active:scale-95`)
5. **Optimized typography**: Scales from mobile to desktop

### Color Palette

- **Primary**: Blue-to-Cyan gradient (#3B82F6 → #06B6D4)

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

### Responsive Breakpoints

```css
Mobile:   < 640px   (base, no prefix)
Tablet:   sm: 640px+

## 🔄 Progressive Disclosure Strategy

### What We Hide Initially

3. **Step 3**: Workspace overview (hide file details until click)
4. **Step 4**: Data room (tabs hide content until selected)

### Mobile Considerations

- Collapsible sections
- Expandable cards
- Tab navigation (instead of showing all at once)
- "Show more" buttons
- Bottom sheets (future)
