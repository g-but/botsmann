# Trident - Multi-AI Documentation Tool for Cursor

## Overview

The Trident is a specialized bot that revolutionizes product documentation by combining the unique perspectives of three leading AI models: ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok. It's designed specifically to create comprehensive, balanced, and technically precise documentation for the Cursor platform.

Unlike single-AI documentation tools, the Trident synthesizes multiple viewpoints to create documentation that's more thorough, balanced, and insightful than any individual AI could produce alone.

## Key Features

### Multi-AI Collaboration

The Trident leverages the distinct strengths of three AI models:

- **ChatGPT**: Creative, expansive thinking and comprehensive coverage
- **Claude**: Nuanced analysis, ethical considerations, and edge case identification
- **Grok**: Direct, no-nonsense specifications and practical implementation details

By combining these perspectives, the system produces documentation that balances creativity, thoroughness, and practicality.

### Cursor-Optimized Documentation

Based on Cursor's preferences, the documentation:

- Provides clear intent and boundaries
- Specifies critical constraints and non-functional requirements
- Avoids excessive implementation details that would restrict engineering creativity
- Presents technology suggestions with rationale rather than rigid prescriptions
- Includes diagrams for complex concepts
- Uses examples to illustrate expected behaviors

### Comprehensive Documentation Format

Each generated document follows a structured format:

1. **System Overview & Architecture**
   - High-level architecture diagram
   - Core workflow visualization
   - Key system components and their relationships
   - Primary use cases with examples

2. **Functional Requirements**
   - Prioritized as "must-have," "should-have," and "nice-to-have"
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Performance expectations

3. **Technical Specifications**
   - API contracts and interfaces
   - Data structures and schemas
   - State management approach
   - Security considerations

4. **Component Design**
   - Purpose and responsibilities for each component
   - Input/output specifications
   - Key processing logic

5. **Implementation Considerations**
   - Suggested tech stack with rationale
   - Potential implementation challenges
   - Alternative approaches
   - Performance optimization opportunities

6. **Testing Strategy**
   - Key test scenarios
   - Suggested approaches for measuring KPIs
   - Critical edge cases

## How It Works

The system follows a four-step process:

1. **Query Analysis**: The user's documentation request is analyzed to understand the core requirements and domain

2. **Multi-AI Processing**: The query is distributed to ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok, with each AI focusing on its strengths:
   - ChatGPT: Broad creative options, feature flows, and integration points
   - Claude: Edge cases, security considerations, and ethical implications
   - Grok: Core specifications, direct requirements, and performance targets

3. **Insight Fusion**: A sophisticated fusion engine:
   - Extracts unique contributions from each AI
   - Resolves conflicts and contradictions
   - Weights insights based on relevance and confidence
   - Organizes content into a cohesive structure

4. **Documentation Generation**: A comprehensive document is produced in Cursor's preferred format

## Use Cases

The Trident excels at generating documentation for:

- **Feature Specifications**: Detailed requirements for new features
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API descriptions with endpoints, parameters, and examples
- **System Architecture**: Design documents for complex systems
- **Implementation Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for technical implementations
- **Migration Plans**: Strategies for system upgrades or database migrations

## Benefits for Cursor

As an AI coding assistant, Cursor receives several advantages from this specialized documentation:

1. **Balanced Perspective**: Multiple AI viewpoints ensure all angles are considered
2. **Implementation Flexibility**: Clear requirements without overly prescriptive implementation details
3. **Comprehensive Edge Case Handling**: Identification of potential issues before implementation
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined scope and constraints
5. **Outcome-Oriented**: Focus on what needs to be achieved rather than mandating specific approaches

## Development Status

The Trident is currently in development. The frontend user interface is implemented, while the backend integration with multiple AI models and the fusion engine is under development.

Future enhancements will include:
- Interactive documentation adjustment
- Real-time collaboration features
- Documentation version control
- Integration with code generation tools
