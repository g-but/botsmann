# Nerd - AI Research Assistant

## Overview

Nerd is an AI-powered research assistant designed to enhance research workflows by organizing data, providing real-time updates, generating content, posing thought-provoking questions, facilitating collaboration, and aiming for breakthrough discoveries. The platform supports academics, scientists, journalists, students, and industry professionals in their research endeavors.

## Philosophy & Vision

Nerd envisions a future where humans and machines collaborate fluidly in pursuit of truth and knowledge. The platform is built on three core principles:

1. **Human-AI Symbiosis**: Developing intelligent systems that enhance human creativity and analytical capabilities, creating a relationship that elevates research beyond current limitations.

2. **Decentralized Access**: Democratizing research through alternative systems and removing institutional barriers that prevent brilliant minds from contributing, regardless of formal credentials.

3. **Accelerated Discovery**: Creating systems that identify promising connections across disciplines, surface overlooked research, and generate novel hypotheses—dramatically speeding the path to breakthrough discoveries.

Our platform embodies principles of Decentralized Science (DeSci), contributing to a future where scientific progress is driven by merit and collaboration rather than credentials and institutional affiliations.

## Core Features

### 1. Research Organization
- **Automated Systematization**: Organize uploaded research materials (PDFs, texts, notes) with AI-powered categorization
- **Smart Tagging**: Automatically extract and organize key concepts, authors, and methodologies
- **Knowledge Graph**: Visualize connections between research elements

### 2. Real-time Updates
- **Literature Monitoring**: Track new publications in your field from sources like arXiv and academic journals
- **News & Trends**: Stay informed about relevant developments in your research area
- **Custom Alerts**: Receive notifications for research that matches specific criteria

### 3. Content Creation
- **Research Drafts**: Generate structured content like abstracts, literature reviews, and methodology sections
- **Citation Management**: Automatic formatting of citations in various styles
- **Social Media Content**: Create shareable summaries of your research for broader audiences

### 4. Research Engagement
- **Research Rabbit Holes**: Explore thought-provoking questions related to your field
- **Discovery Mode**: Identify research gaps and suggest novel connections between concepts
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Propose testable hypotheses based on existing literature

### 5. Collaboration
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless workflows with Zotero, Notion, Google Drive, and GitHub
- **Peer Connections**: Find researchers working in similar areas
- **Resource Sharing**: Access shared datasets, code, and methodologies

### 6. Independent Research
- **Decentralized Funding**: Access alternative funding mechanisms for research projects
- **Anonymous Contributions**: Contribute to research without institutional constraints
- **Community Governance**: Participate in decision-making through decentralized structures

## State Management

Nerd uses React's built-in state management with hooks for component-level state. Components that need to share state use prop-drilling or context where appropriate. The primary state elements include:

- **User Preferences**: Research fields, notification settings, tool connections
- **Content State**: Active sections, selected research materials, draft progress
- **UI State**: Navigation state, active tabs, mobile responsiveness

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Documentation

#### Navigation Component
The `Navigation` component provides a responsive menu that highlights the six core functions of Nerd. It implements scroll-based appearance/disappearance and smooth scrolling to sections.

#### Hero Section
The `HeroSection` component introduces users to Nerd with a compelling value proposition and call-to-action. It animates key features and provides a visually engaging introduction.

#### Feature Components
- `ResearchSystemSection`: Demonstrates how Nerd organizes research with interactive visualization
- `WebScrapingSection`: Shows real-time update capabilities with example feeds
- `DraftGenerationSection`: Showcases content creation with interactive examples of different document types

#### Research Engagement Components
- `QuestionsSection`: Provides the container for research questions
- `DailyQuestionsSection`: Implements the Research Rabbit Holes feature with customizable questions by research field

#### Discovery Component
The `DiscoverySection` demonstrates how Nerd identifies research gaps and suggests novel connections with interactive examples across different research domains.

#### Integration Components
- `IntegrationSection`: Shows tool integration capabilities and collaboration features
- `DevelopmentRoadmap`: Displays development timeline, vision, and collaboration opportunities

### Adding New Features

To add new features to Nerd:

1. Create a new component in the appropriate subdirectory of `components/`
2. Document the component with JSDoc comments
3. Update the relevant section in `page.tsx` to include your new component
4. If needed, add new styles in `styles.module.css`
