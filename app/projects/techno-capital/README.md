# Botsmann Techno-Capital Assets

This document outlines the image assets needed for the Techno-Capital project section.

## Required Images

1. **techno-capital-hero.jpg**
   - Location: `/public/images/techno-capital-hero.jpg`
   - Description: A hero image showing a futuristic tunnel or underground structure with technological elements, representing the visionary aspect of the Techno-Capital initiative
   - Suggested dimensions: 1920x1080px (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - Style: Dark theme with OpenAI green accents

2. **techno-capital.jpg**
   - Location: `/public/images/techno-capital.jpg`
   - Description: A smaller thumbnail version for the projects listing page
   - Suggested dimensions: 800x450px (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - Style: Should match the hero image style but optimized for thumbnail display

## Image Guidelines

- Images should follow the Botsmann design aesthetic with dark backgrounds and OpenAI green (#10A37F) accents
- Images should convey the technological singularity and underground/subterranean themes
- For placeholder purposes, solid color blocks with text can be used until final images are created
- Consider using AI image generation tools (like DALL-E or Midjourney) with prompts like:
  - "Futuristic underground tunnel with green technological lighting, digital interfaces, dark aesthetic"
  - "Technological singularity concept visualization with dark background and emerald green accents"

## Image Directory Setup

The directory structure should be:

```
/public
  /images
    techno-capital-hero.jpg
    techno-capital.jpg
```

You can create placeholder images using online tools or basic graphic design software until final assets are ready.
