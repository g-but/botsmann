## Slide 2: The Problem

### Current AI Assistants Have Critical Flaws

**Privacy Concerns** 🔒

- User data harvested and used for training
- Sensitive documents stored on third-party servers
- No control over data residency

**Vendor Lock-in** ⛓️

- Forced to use single LLM provider
- Unpredictable pricing changes

- Can't customize for specific workflows

### The Cost

- **Enterprises:** $50B+ spent on generic AI tools that can't meet compliance requirements
- **Professionals:** Legal, medical, research fields hesitant to adopt AI due to privacy concerns
- **Governments:** Sovereignty concerns block AI adoption in critical services

## Slide 12: Risks & Mitigation

### Key Risks

**1. Competition from Big Tech** 🏢

- **Risk:** Google, Microsoft, OpenAI add privacy features
- **Mitigation:**
  - Self-hosted moat (big tech won't offer)
  - Domain specialization (deeper than generic assistants)
  - Multi-provider strategy (not locked to one LLM)

**2. LLM Cost Increases** 💸

- **Risk:** Groq ends free tier, OpenAI raises prices
- **Mitigation:**
  - Multi-provider architecture (switch easily)
  - Local Ollama option (zero LLM costs)
  - BYOK model (users pay their own LLM costs)

**3. Slow Enterprise Sales** ⏳

- **Risk:** Long sales cycles in legal/medical sectors
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with individuals (product-led growth)
  - Build case studies from small firms
  - Partner with existing software vendors (channels)

**4. Privacy Regulations** 📜

- **Risk:** New laws make RAG implementation harder
- **Mitigation:**
  - Privacy-first architecture (ahead of regulations)
  - Self-hosted option (meets strictest requirements)
  - Legal counsel on compliance

**5. Technology Risk** ⚙️

- **Risk:** Embedding models become obsolete, RAG improvements needed
- **Mitigation:**
  - Modular architecture (swap embedding models easily)
  - Active monitoring of AI research
  - Budget for continuous R&D
