## 5. Unit Economics

### 5.1 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Premium Users:**

- Marketing spend: $7,500/month
- New premium users/month: 150 (avg)
- **CAC = $7,500 / 150 = $50**

**Enterprise Customers:**

- Sales team cost: $200K/year
- New enterprise customers/year: 40
- **CAC = $200K / 40 = $5,000**

### 5.2 Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Premium Users:**

- ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): $29/month
- Gross Margin: 80%
- Churn Rate: 15%/year = 1.25%/month
- **LTV = $29 × 0.80 / 0.0125 = $1,856**

**Enterprise Customers:**

- ARPU: $25,000/year
- Gross Margin: 90%
- Churn Rate: 10%/year
- **LTV = $25,000 × 0.90 / 0.10 = $225,000**

### 5.3 LTV:CAC Ratio

**Premium:**

- LTV: $1,856
- CAC: $50
- **LTV:CAC = 37:1** (Excellent)

**Enterprise:**

- LTV: $225,000
- CAC: $5,000
- **LTV:CAC = 45:1** (Excellent)

**Target:** > 3:1 (Industry standard for healthy SaaS)
**Botsmann:** 37-45:1 (Outstanding, room to invest more in growth)

### 5.4 Payback Period

**Premium:**

- CAC: $50
- Monthly gross profit per user: $29 × 0.80 = $23.20
- **Payback = $50 / $23.20 = 2.2 months**

**Enterprise:**

- CAC: $5,000
- Monthly gross profit: $25,000 × 0.90 / 12 = $1,875
- **Payback = $5,000 / $1,875 = 2.7 months**

**Target:** < 12 months
**Botsmann:** 2-3 months (Excellent)

### 5.5 Cohort Analysis

**Month 0 Cohort (100 premium users sign up):**
| Month | Active Users | Churn | Revenue | Cumulative Revenue |
|-------|--------------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 0 | 100 | 0 | $2,900 | $2,900 |
| 1 | 99 | 1% | $2,871 | $5,771 |
