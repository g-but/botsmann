      "content": "The most common Swiss German greeting is 'Grüezi' (GREW-tsee), used in formal situations. For informal settings, use 'Hoi' or 'Sali'. In the morning, say 'Guete Morge' (good morning), and in the evening 'Guete Abig' (good evening). When leaving, 'Uf Widerluege' is the formal goodbye, while 'Tschüss' or 'Ciao' work for casual situations.",

      "content": "'Grüezi' is formal and respectful—use it with strangers, in shops, at work, or with older people. 'Hoi' is casual and friendly—use it with friends, younger people, or in relaxed settings. Using 'Hoi' with a stranger might seem too familiar, while 'Grüezi' with close friends might feel distant. In Zürich, you'll hear both constantly.",
